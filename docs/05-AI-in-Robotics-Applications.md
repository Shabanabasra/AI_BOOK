# AI in Robotics Applications

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in modern robotics. By integrating AI, robots can perceive their environment, make decisions, learn from experience, and perform complex tasks autonomously. AI enables robots to adapt to changing situations and perform tasks more efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand how AI enhances robot capabilities
- Identify key AI techniques used in robotics
- Explore real-world applications of AI in robots
- Perform basic exercises to simulate AI-driven robot behavior

## Key Concepts
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Robots use ML algorithms to learn from data and improve performance over time.
- **Computer Vision:** Enables robots to see and interpret objects, people, and surroundings using cameras and sensors.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Allows robots to understand and respond to human language.
- **Path Planning:** AI helps robots plan the most efficient path to reach a destination while avoiding obstacles.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Robots make decisions based on environmental data and predefined goals.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Robots learn optimal behaviors through trial and error with rewards and penalties.

## Hands-on Examples / Exercises
1. **Object Recognition with AI:** Use a camera sensor and an ML model to classify objects on a table.
2. **Voice Command Robot:** Program a robot to respond to simple voice commands like "pick up the box" or "move forward".
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Use sensor data and AI algorithms to navigate a robot through a room without collisions.
4. **Path Planning Simulation:** Implement a basic path planning algorithm to move a robot from start to goal on a 2D grid.
5. **Reinforcement Learning Task:** Train a robot in a simulation to reach a target while avoiding obstacles using simple reward-based learning.
